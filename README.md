# 🔬 Fluorimetry Data Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the **Fluorimetry Data Analysis** project!

This **Dash web application** was developed to **automate data analysis from fluorimetry experiments** in the field of **targeted cancer nanoparticle therapeutics**. It streamlines a traditionally manual process to quickly determine how much of a drug has successfully **conjugated (linked)** to a nanoparticle—a key step in assessing the effectiveness of nano-drug delivery systems in cancer treatment.
